Marvellous Restaurant Record App is a frontend web application developed using Angular and TypeScript that provides a structured platform for managing restaurant information. The application implements user authentication (Sign Up & Login) to ensure secure access to restaurant records.

After authentication, users can add, view, and manage restaurant details through a clean and intuitive interface. Restaurant data such as name, email, address, contact number, and services offered are captured using Angular forms and displayed in a tabular format. The project follows Angular’s component-based architecture, utilizes routing for navigation, and applies data binding for dynamic UI updates.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Angular routing, form handling, component communication, and UI state management, making it suitable as a real-world frontend application and a strong foundation for future backend integration.
